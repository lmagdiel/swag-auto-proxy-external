# Auto-proxy-external - Docker mod for SWAG
# WIP

The objective of this mod is to automatically enable reverse proxy for external services using one very simple yaml config file mounted to SWAG.

As with swag-auto-proxy, this avoids having to directly edit proxy conf files, with the added benefit of simplifying ansible automations.
